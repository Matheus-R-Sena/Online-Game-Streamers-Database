# Online Game Streamers Database
 This is a project from our University. In this project, we're building a database to help streamers answer some questions:  
 
 1- Public reach 
 2- Number of advertisements 
 3- Direct fundraising (donations) 
 4- Indirect fundraising (subscribers) 
 5- Number of direct interactions (online comments) 
 6- Number of interactions (online + offline comments).
 
 Our project covers all of the steps of creating a database:
 
 1- Requirements analysis 
 2- Conceptual design 
 3- Logical design 
 4- Physical design 
 5- Implementation.

 You can find all of the building stages in the appropriate folders.
